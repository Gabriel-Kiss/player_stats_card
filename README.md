# PulseLive Coding Challenge - Player Stats Card

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisits

Node has to be installed on your machine in order for this project to run.

### Local Machine

To start with, open a terminal and clone this repo [player_stats_card](https://github.com/Gabriel-Kiss/player_stats_card.git) into your local machine.

#### To start the web app

1. In the terminal, navigate to the newly created folder and run **_npm install_**;
2. Once all dependecies are installed, in the same terminal, run **_npx serve_** to start the app locally (you might be prompted to install some more packages);
3. If you want to make any changes to the main.scss file, in a new terminal window run **_npm run css-compile_** which will compile the scss into css and minify it when code changes are saved (browser needs to be refreshed manually for changes to take place);
4. The app should be running on http://localhost:3000;
5. Alternatively, if using [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), check the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension which will start the app on local host as well, and will refresh the browser automatically on code change save.
